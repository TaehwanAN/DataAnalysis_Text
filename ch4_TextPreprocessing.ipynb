It's worth noting the females working there can outdrink ANYONE. Anyway, there was a sign on the front door that read 'No Club Colors'. So we lose our ties and blazers before heading there. Also we assumed bright colors like red, yellow, green etc were not allowed. So we would always bring an xtra t-shirt and pair of jeans. This went on for years! Looking back now on how naive we were, it's just hilarious. I was never able to walk out of that bar....had to crawl out! So much booze. &lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Cheers. Ride safe, boys!</td>\n",

       "0      Funny story. I went to college in Las Vegas. This was before I knew anything about motorcycling whatsoever. Me and some college buddies would always go out on the strip to the dance clubs. We always ended up at a bar called Hogs &amp; Heifers. It's worth noting the females working there can outdrink ANYONE. Anyway, there was a sign on the front door that read 'No Club Colors'. So we lose our ties and blazers before heading there. Also we assumed bright colors like red, yellow, green etc were not allowed. So we would always bring an xtra t-shirt and pair of jeans. This went on for years! Looking back now on how naive we were, it's just hilarious. I was never able to walk out of that bar....had to crawl out! So much booze. <lb><lb>Cheers. Ride safe, boys!    \n",
