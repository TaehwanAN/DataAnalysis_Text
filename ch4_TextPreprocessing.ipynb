My question is, when I return that money, is it going to count against my contribution for 2017? More specifically, say I take out $1,000 dollars and return it within 60 days, am I only able to now contribute an additional $4,500 for 2017 or can I still contribute the full $5,500 for 2017?&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;I really appreciate any help anyone can offer.</td>\n",

The name of the company is Expedition Engraving LLC and we need to come up with a logo for website, cards, email signatures, etc. The ideas below were agreed upon by myself and my partner:&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;*  Use of a 3d compass rose to the left of the wording with a laser finishing the design of it, something similar to this but no directional letters: https://us.123rf.com/450wm/sergeiminsk/sergeiminsk1501/sergeiminsk150100006/35308597-compass-rose-isolated-on-white-vector-illustration.jpg?ver=6&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;It's not a deal breaker, but the business name implies some kind of adventure, thus the compass&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;* Alternatively, an italicized and bolded Expedition Engraving with a laser finishing the logo out.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;* With any design, black and white would be preferable to color since we can't engrave in color. Our cards will likely be aluminum sheets engraved with the logo and contact information. The kind of feel we're going for in the logo has to reflect the use of lasers.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Our budget is roughly $100. If required, a $25 deposit can be made and the balance upon completion, preferably through PayPal.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Deliverables in this case will be the final logo in a PNG or PS format and a simplified outline logo that can be ran through quickly on the engraving in the same format.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;You folks are the professionals here, I'm more than open to suggestions and ideas. Thank you for looking and any responses received. Look forward to hearing from y'all.</td>\n",

This question could also be under any other monsters that have an ally monster attack with them. So say i use Lisa's 3rd ability and it attacks with Charlotte. For those who don't know, Charlotte's first skill has a chance to put the enemy to sleep. If this happens then she gets a second turn. <lb><lb><lb>So would Charlotte get a second turn if she puts an enemy to sleep if she was attack with Lisa?    \n",
       "924671  We recently opened a new home-based laser engraving business on Expedition Creek. The name of the company is Expedition Engraving LLC and we need to come up with a logo for website, cards, email signatures, etc. The ideas below were agreed upon by myself and my partner:<lb><lb>*  Use of a 3d compass rose to the left of the wording with a laser finishing the design of it, something similar to this but no directional letters: https://us.123rf.com/450wm/sergeiminsk/sergeiminsk1501/sergeiminsk150100006/35308597-compass-rose-isolated-on-white-vector-illustration.jpg?ver=6<lb><lb>It's not a deal breaker, but the business name implies some kind of adventure, thus the compass<lb><lb>* Alternatively, an italicized and bolded Expedition Engraving with a laser finishing the logo out.<lb><lb>* With any design, black and white would be preferable to color since we can't engrave in color. Our cards will likely be aluminum sheets engraved with the logo and contact information. The kind of feel we're going for in the logo has to reflect the use of lasers.<lb><lb>Our budget is roughly $100. If required, a $25 deposit can be made and the balance upon completion, preferably through PayPal.<lb><lb>Deliverables in this case will be the final logo in a PNG or PS format and a simplified outline logo that can be ran through quickly on the engraving in the same format.<lb><lb>You folks are the professionals here, I'm more than open to suggestions and ideas. Thank you for looking and any responses received. Look forward to hearing from y'all.   \n",

       "      <td>Ok, apologies for the title, and really anything I say here. I am well aware that there are probably so many posts out here like this on the internet, however, personally I am finding trouble finding those posts.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;So, I've been thinking about creating a Tulpa for a while now. I've read a few guides on it too, and I really want to take up the commitment. I already know it will be challenging, and there will be downsides. I've read plenty of posts concerning that as well.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;My issue is that I have no clue where to start.&lt;lb&gt;Like, where do I even begin?&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Here are some of my problems&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;1.) Visualizing&lt;lb&gt;I've heard a lot of talk about visualizing your Tulpa. Some say it can even speed development of one, however, I simply have trouble with even visualizing anything. I'm like a dim bulb. I (kind of) work, but not really anything compared to a normal, fully functioning bulb.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;I can visualize things, but to a certain extend. For example, I can visualize a picture of my sisters face if I try, however it usually seems really dark and desaturated for some reason, and if I focus on one certain part of the image, I cannot see anything else.&lt;lb&gt;Other times though, I just see completely nothing. Just black. That's it.&lt;lb&gt;I just find myself having a terrible time visualizing.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;I've heard that it can become better over time, and that is cool. Does anyone in the community have any tips?&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;(Also, I've been hearing a lot of word going around about Aphantasia, and I am pretty sure that I don't have it. I have poor visualization, not none at all.)&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;2.) What to do..(?)&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Like, how do you start even if you can visualize? Some people say to introduce yourself to them, and I've tried that, but I just really get confused about what to do next. I'll (kind of) speak in my head (if that is the correct term to it) and describe what I am doing, but it doesn't feel right.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;(For example, if I am petting a cat, I'll describe petting a cat, and what a cat even is, stuff like that)&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;I just know I'm probably doing something wrong.&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Does anyone have any tips on getting started?&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Tulpas are really interesting, and I really want to try to get invested in it and make one, however I just think that I am doing something wrong...&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;Also, here are some misc questions (that might have been answered hundreds of times before) if you feel like answering:&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;- Can you change your dreamscape (if you and your Tulpa agree too), like, if your dreamscape is a wooden house, could you change it to a castle, or is it permanent?&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;- Is there any guide that you recommend? If so, please tell me, it would be very helpful&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;- What is the most annoying thing your Tulpa has ever done or said to you? (for Host)&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;- What is the most annoying think your Host have ever done or said to you? (for Tulpa)&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;- How hard is it to make a Tulpa (in your experience)&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;&lt;lb&gt;*TLDR - I am totally confused on where to start, I also suck at visualizing, and any help on some overall direction would be really nice*</td>\n",

       "text         Ok, apologies for the title, and really anything I say here. I am well aware that there are probably so many posts out here like this on the internet, however, personally I am finding trouble finding those posts.<lb><lb>So, I've been thinking about creating a Tulpa for a while now. I've read a few guides on it too, and I really want to take up the commitment. I already know it will be challenging, and there will be downsides. I've read plenty of posts concerning that as well.<lb><lb>My issue is that I have no clue where to start.<lb>Like, where do I even begin?<lb><lb>Here are some of my problems<lb><lb>1.) Visualizing<lb>I've heard a lot of talk about visualizing your Tulpa. Some say it can even speed development of one, however, I simply have trouble with even visualizing anything. I'm like a dim bulb. I (kind of) work, but not really anything compared to a normal, fully functioning bulb.<lb><lb>I can visualize things, but to a certain extend. For example, I can visualize a picture of my sisters face if I try, however it usually seems really dark and desaturated for some reason, and if I focus on one certain part of the image, I cannot see anything else.<lb>Other times though, I just see completely nothing. Just black. That's it.<lb>I just find myself having a terrible time visualizing.<lb><lb>I've heard that it can become better over time, and that is cool. Does anyone in the community have any tips?<lb><lb>(Also, I've been hearing a lot of word going around about Aphantasia, and I am pretty sure that I don't have it. I have poor visualization, not none at all.)<lb><lb>2.) What to do..(?)<lb><lb>Like, how do you start even if you can visualize? Some people say to introduce yourself to them, and I've tried that, but I just really get confused about what to do next. I'll (kind of) speak in my head (if that is the correct term to it) and describe what I am doing, but it doesn't feel right.<lb><lb>(For example, if I am petting a cat, I'll describe petting a cat, and what a cat even is, stuff like that)<lb><lb>I just know I'm probably doing something wrong.<lb><lb><lb><lb>Does anyone have any tips on getting started?<lb><lb>Tulpas are really interesting, and I really want to try to get invested in it and make one, however I just think that I am doing something wrong...<lb><lb><lb><lb><lb><lb><lb>Also, here are some misc questions (that might have been answered hundreds of times before) if you feel like answering:<lb><lb>- Can you change your dreamscape (if you and your Tulpa agree too), like, if your dreamscape is a wooden house, could you change it to a castle, or is it permanent?<lb><lb>- Is there any guide that you recommend? If so, please tell me, it would be very helpful<lb><lb>- What is the most annoying thing your Tulpa has ever done or said to you?

I'm considering buying a Gen1 Volt, but I can't find any straight answers as to what kind of mpg it gets after the battery is completely dead (say I take a 300 mile trip).  What kind of highway mpg does the Gen1 volt get after the battery is depleted?    \n",

It has Vance radius pipes, t bars, screaming eagle filters, sissy bar, new seat and either a new tank or a new paint job as it does not say Harley Davidson on the tank anywhere but has pin stripes.. the title it’s clean but it just seems to good to be true and the sales man has no record of it being in a accident or not. The Title has been transferred to 5 different owners (can not see prices) I really want this bike but I’m skeptical. Any ideas or tips to look for?   \n",
